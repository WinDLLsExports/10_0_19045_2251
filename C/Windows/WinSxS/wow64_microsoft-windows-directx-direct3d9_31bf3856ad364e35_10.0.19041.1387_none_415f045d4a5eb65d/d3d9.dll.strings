(previous instruction) Co-issued instruction cannot write all components - must write either alpha or color.
(previous instruction) Dot-product needs color/vector pipeline to execute, so instruction co-issued with it cannot write to color components.
(previous instruction) Dot-product which writes alpha cannot co-issue, because both alpha and color/vector pipelines used by the dot product.
(previous instruction) dp3 needs color pipe to execute, so instruction co-issued with it cannot write to color components.
(previous instruction) dp3 which writes alpha cannot co-issue since it uses up both the alpha and color pipes.

Decl using method other than '%s' cannot be used with points or lines. Encountered method: '%s'.
Declaration cannot combine generation method 'lookup'/'lookuppresampled' with methods other than 'default'.
Declaration can't map to fixed function FVF because a generation method other than D3DDECLMETHOD_DEFAULT is used.
Declaration can't map to fixed function FVF because a usage+index pair (%s,%d) that is not valid for fixed function appears between two vertex elements that have usage+index pairs valid for fixed function. For a vertex declaration to map to fixed function, all individual elements that are valid for fixed function must appear contiguously starting from the first element.  Remaining elements at the end do not have to be valid for fixed function, as long as there are few enough that they can be aliased internally to texcoord(n), texcoord(n+1) etc. up to max. texcoord7 (thereby appearing to conform to an FVF, although the aliased values should not be used).

Declaration can't map to fixed function FVF because the type for this element is unsupported.
Declaration can't map to fixed function FVF because there are both (a) elements with usage+index pairs that are not valid for fixed function and (b) generation methods other than DEFAULT in the same decl. For a vertex declaration to map to fixed function, all individual elements with usage+index pairs valid for fixed function must appear contiguously starting from the first element.  Remaining elements at the end do not have to be valid for fixed function, as long as there are few enough that they can be aliased internally to texcoord(n), texcoord(n+1) etc. up to max. texcoord7 (thereby appearing to conform to an FVF, although the aliased values should not be used). Additionally, when such aliasing occurs, all elements in the decl are then required to simply use generation method D3DDECLMETHOD_DEFAULT, for mapping to fixed function to work.
Declaration can't map to fixed function FVF because there are gaps in the texture coordinates. 
Declaration can't map to fixed function FVF because there are too many blend weights (%d). Max allowed is %d.
Declaration can't map to fixed function FVF because there are too many usage+index pairs that are not valid for fixed function. To clarify: For a vertex declaration to map to fixed function, all individual elements with usage+index pairs valid for fixed function must appear contiguously starting from the first element.  Remaining elements at the end do not have to be valid for fixed function, as long as there are few enough that they can be aliased internally to texcoord(n), texcoord(n+1) etc. up to max. texcoord7 (thereby appearing to conform to an FVF, although the aliased values should not be used). 
Declaration can't map to fixed function FVF because usage+index %s,%d is not supported.
Declaration can't map to fixed function on dx8 driver because there are both (a) elements with usage+index pairs that are not valid for dx8 driver and (b) generation methods other than DEFAULT in the same decl. For a vertex declaration to map to fixed funtion on dx8 drvier, all individual elements with usage+index pairs valid for dx8 must appear contiguously starting from the first element.

To clarify: For a vertex declaration to map to fixed function on a dx8 driver, all individual elements with usage+index pairs that are valid for fixed funtion on dx8 must appear contiguously starting from the first element.  Remaining elements at the end do not have to be valid for fixed function, as long as there are few enough that they can be aliased internally to texcoord(n), texcoord(n+1) etc. up to max. texcoord7 (thereby appearing to conform to a dx8 decl, although the aliased values should not be used). 
Declaration can't map to fixed function on dx8 driver because there is a nonzero stream index AND there are element(s) that do not map to FVF. 
Declaration can't map to LEGACY fixed function FVF because device does not support blendindices. 
Declaration can't map to LEGACY fixed function FVF because device does not support psize.

Declaration can't map to LEGACY fixed function FVF because position cannot have usage index greater than 0. Usage index specified is %d.
Declaration can't map to legacy fixed function FVF because vertex element ordering must follow FVF order. 
Declaration can't map to legacy FVF because a nonzero stream index is used: %d.
Declaration element [%d] specifies generation method '%s', but the stream (%d) and offset (%d) specified do not match up with any element in the declaration that has method 'default'.
Declaration element [%d] specifies generation method '%s'. For this method, the input data type listed must be equal to the type at the 'default' element with the specified source stream (%d) and offset (%d). 
Declaration element [%d] specifies generation method '%s'. For this method, the input data type must be one of: float3, float4, d3dcolor, ubyte4 or short4. Type provided for this element is: %s
Declaration element [%d] specifies generation method 'lookup', but stream (%d) and offset (%d) partially overlap with vertex element [%d] (having method 'default'). Elements with generation method 'lookup' must satisfy either of two conditions: (1) stream+offset+type for 'lookup' element does not overlap at all with any other element having method 'default'. In this case, it is required that incoming vertex data at stream+offset+type specified for 'lookup' element contains coordinates for the lookup. After being used the coords will be discarded and replaced by lookup results in the set of data passed to the rest of the vertex pipe.(2) stream+offset exactly matches another element in declaration having method 'default', and the types of both are the same. In this case, coordinates for lookup come from 'default' element, and output vertex data after lookup contains both 'default' data, plus new lookup results. 
Declaration element [%d] specifies generation method 'lookup', where stream (%d) and offset (%d) match another element with method 'default'. This is fine, however both elements must list the same data type, which they currently do not.
Declaration for register %s%d overlaps previous declaration for the following component(s) of the same register (*): %s
Declaration has too many vertex elements (%d).  Max allowed, including D3DDECL_END(), is %d. Aborting decl validation.

A 2nd order dependent tex-op occurs if: a tex-op reads OR WRITES to an r# reg whose contents, BEFORE executing the tex-op, depend (perhaps indirectly) on the outcome of a 1st order dependent tex-op. An (n)th order dependent tex-op derives from an (n-1)th order tex-op. A given tex-op may be dependent to at most 3rd order (ps_2_0/x only).

DepthStencil Format is not supported for this Adapter/DevType/AdapterFormat. This error can happen if the application has not successfully called CheckDeviceFormats on the specified Format prior to calling CheckDepthStencilMatch. The application is advised to call CheckDeviceFormats on this format first, because a success return from CheckDepthStencilMatch does not guarantee that the format is valid as a DepthStencil buffer for all possible cases i.e. D3DRTYPE_TEXTURE or D3DRTYPE_SURFACE or D3DRTYPE_CUBETEXTURE.

Type field contains value that is not a member of D3DDECLTYPE. Value: 0x%x.  Aborting decl validation.
Type, Stream, and Offset fields are not used in combination with generation method D3DDECLMETHOD_UV or D3DDECLMETHOD_LOOKUPPRESAMPLED, so Type is required to be D3DDECLTYPE_UNUSED, and Stream and Offset are required to be 0. This 0 requirement is arbitrary, and there is no relevance/conflict if another vertex element actually occupies Stream 0 and Offset 0 using D3DDECLMETHOD_DEFAULT.

When a %s shader writes to oCn, it must write to all of oC(n-1) down to oC0 (no gaps).
When a phase marker is present in a shader, texdepth is only permitted after the phase marker.
When a phase marker is present in a shader, texkill is only permitted after the phase marker.
When aL is used as a relative address, it must not specify any swizzle, as it is a scalar register. Aborting validation.
When constant registers are read multiple times in a single instruction, the _abs modifier must either be present on all of the constants, or none of them. 
When multple usages are declared for various components of a given input v# register, the _centroid hint can only be specified on either (a) all usages declared for the register, or (b) on none of them.  Also note that the usage 'color' (with any index) has special behavior: even if the centroid hint is not specified for color, it is assumed to be set. 
When predicate register is used as the condition for a %s instruction, a replicate swizzle must be specified, to select a component. i.e. .x | .y | .z | .w (or rgba equivalent)
When relative addressing of output o# registers is used, position0 must be declared in o%d only, psize0 (if present) must be declared in o%d only, and indexing from/into o%d, or o%d (psize0 case only) is undefined. Indexing into any other declared o# is fine. If relative addressing of o# is not used in the shader, these restrictions on register numbers do not apply. 
When specifying NOAUTOROTATE, BackBufferWidth and Height must be equivalent to the DisplayMode in the IDENTITY orienation.
When using the bias source modifier on a register, the previous writer should apply the saturate modifier. This would ensure consistent behaviour across different hardware. Affected components(*) of %s source param: %s
When using the complement source modifier on a register, the previous writer should apply the saturate destination modifier. This would ensure consistent behaviour across different hardware. Affected components(*) of %s source param: %s
When writing to oDepth with predication, p0 must use a replicate swizzle to select a single component: .x | .y | .z | .w
When writing to oDepth, %s instruction must use replicate swizzle on source parameter(s), in order to select single component. i.e. .x | .y | .z | .w (or rgba equivalent)
When writing to scalar output (oFog, oPts) with predication, p0 must use a replicate swizzle to select a single component: .x | .y | .z | .w
When writing to scalar output (psize) with predication, p0 must use a replicate swizzle to select a single component: .x | .y | .z | .w
When writing to scalar output register, %s instruction must use replicate swizzle on source parameter(s), in order to select single component. i.e. .x | .y | .z | .w (or rgba equivalent)

Write mask for CRS must be one of: .x | .y | .z | .xy | .xz | .yz | .xyz (or rgba equivalent)
Write to oCn register cannot use _sat instruction modifier.
Write to oCn register must use full writemask (equivalent to not specifying writemask at all).
Write to oDepth register cannot use _sat instruction modifier.
Write to oDepth register must not specify any writemask. (Note, this is equivalent to using a full writemask) oDepth is a scalar output, however a specific rgba/xyzw channel does not apply -> the writemask is meaningless. 
Write to oDepth register must not specify any writemask. (Note, this is equivalent to using a full writemask) oDepth is a scalar output, however a specific rgba/xyzw channel does not apply; the writemask is meaningless.
