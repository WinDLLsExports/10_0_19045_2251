When all the DNS Servers Timeout, this event is notified
When received shell must show confirmation dialog in a way similar to desktop when accessibility feature hot key was detected (like press Shift 5 times). This dialog must ask whether a user wants to enable this accessibility feature, yes or no. Provided argument rcan be one of the following values: ACCESS_FILTERKEYS, ACCESS_STICKYKEYS, ACCESS_MOUSEKEYS, ACCESS_HIGHCONTRAST, ACCESS_TOGGLEKEYS
When set to the value 1, it indicates that the current composer has finished unintializing.
When this event is received shell must play a specific sound. This event provides sound id and a number of times the sound must be played. These two pieces of information are encoded in a single byte. Sound id stored in low 4 bits and the number of times the sound should be played stored in high 4 bits. Look at comments left for WNF_ACCESSIBILITY_NOTIFICATION structure. Sound id can be one of the following values: RITSOUND_UPSIREN, RITSOUND_DOWNSIREN, RITSOUND_LOWBEEP, RITSOUND_HIGHBEEP, RITSOUND_KEYCLICK, RITSOUND_DOBEEP. The max number of times the sound should be played is 5.
